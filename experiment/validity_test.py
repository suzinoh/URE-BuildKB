"""validity_test.py tests the validity of the NEW RULES produced and measure the accuracy compared with the real-world.
    For each row of produced facts using the rule, we will measure the percentage (how valid it is compared to real-world.
    STEPS:
        * combine all the dictionaries created (delete the rows that are not being used (has_a)?)
        * add on the rules (using the percentage 50 percent, 30 percent, 70 percent)
            <-- idea: might be able to compare the different percentage? -->
                divide the rules into 3 (inf_aff, inf_category, inf_physical)
                use different percentage groupm rules as well
        * get te statistics and compare
